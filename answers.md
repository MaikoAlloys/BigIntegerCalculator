# Answers to the Questions

## What do you love most about computing?
What I love most about computing is the ability to create and solve problems in ways that were once unimaginable. The power of computing lies in its versatility and potential to impact virtually every aspect of life—from transforming industries with automation and artificial intelligence to improving communication and data accessibility. What excites me most is the constant evolution of technology, where new solutions and innovations are always emerging, offering fresh opportunities to learn and grow. I find it incredibly rewarding to use programming and computing to bring ideas to life, automate complex tasks, and help people by making systems more efficient. There's also a sense of infinite possibility; no matter how much progress we make, there are always new frontiers to explore in computing, and that journey of discovery keeps me motivated and curious.

## If you could meet any scientist or engineer who died before A.D. 2000, whom would you choose, and why?
If I could meet any scientist or engineer who died before A.D. 2000, I would choose **Alan Turing**. His contributions to computing, particularly his development of the concept of the Turing machine, laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence. Turing's visionary thinking and ability to conceptualize abstract ideas that later became the building blocks for digital computing are awe-inspiring. What makes his story even more compelling is the tragic nature of his life—his groundbreaking work was not fully recognized during his lifetime, and he faced immense personal struggles. Meeting him would be an opportunity to discuss his thought process and the challenges he encountered, as well as to express admiration for how his work has influenced so many fields. His work resonates with me deeply because it highlights the profound impact one individual can have on shaping the future of humanity.
